### Intro

It's almost a game, made by Greenfoot. And I named it "Apple Odyssey".

What is "Apple Odyssey"? It's a mood game with an apple singing around the space.

The story is about an apple sang a crazy song and got deeper in black. In the deepest black, there is the blue water and it can heal everything, including the injured mind. But things never gonna easy as was heard. At the cost of being lost in the darkness forever until we return to the place where the dream began. An apple has pale skin and want change its color. Here it go.

The goal of this game is simple and awesome: drive your mood crazy.

## 暗黑疯苹果

### 简介

这是一个Greenfoot工具制作的游戏半成品，我称之为“情绪游戏”。命名为：暗黑疯苹果。

一只苹果麦克疯，堕入无边黑暗。

传说，在无边黑暗的最深处，有一汪清泉，能治愈一切，包括受伤的心灵。事情当然没这么简单，代价是会永远迷失在黑暗中，直至回到梦开始的地方。一个苹果皮肤苍白，想要改变它的颜色。故事开始了。这款游戏的目标就是“使玩家陷入错乱、奋斗、无望的情绪”。
